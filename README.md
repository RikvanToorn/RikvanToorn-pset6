This app uses th API from 'bandsintown'. The user can register an account and use that account to log in.
On the homescreen the user can enter an artist in the edittext to search for an artist. The user is redirected to an artist-info-screen
where the artist name and a picture of the artist is shown. Below is a list if there are any events that artist has in the area of the user.
The user can choose to add or delete the user from its artist list. 

On the homescreen the user can see all the artist and the amount of events of that artist in the area.
there is also a drop-down menu where the user can logout or go to the settingsscreen where the user can edit his or her username.

SOMETIMES THE API DOESNT WORK WHEN THE APP IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE WIFI SO PLEASE USE THE APP WHEN IT IS CONNECTED TO A WIFI CONNECTION.
